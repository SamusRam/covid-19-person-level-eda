## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Moreover, the easiest way how to carry on with analyzing this data without the need to set up local environment is to fork a corresponding [Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/samusram/covid-19-person-level-drill-down-czechia-canada).

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

There are mainly cumulative COVID-19 statistics for larger populations, e.g. country-level counts of infected people.
Being valuable, it tells us little about COVID-19 situation for an age/gender group our parents belong to, or the group of our partners, or our siblingsâ€™ age/gender.
In this project I'll present a prelimenary analysis of currently available person-level information about age and gender groups in The Czech Republic.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 main notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
